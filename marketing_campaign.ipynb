|\n\n\n**Insights:**\n\n* Customers who have not complained and responded positively to campaigns have higher average incomes and spend more across all product categories.\n* Complaints generally correlate with lower average spending and income, suggesting dissatisfied customers are less engaged and less likely to respond to campaigns positively.\n\n## Correlation Analysis\nThe correlation between income and various spending categories shows:\n```\nSELECT \n    CORR(Income, MntWines) AS corr_income_wines,\n    CORR(Income, MntMeatProducts) AS corr_income_meats,\n    CORR(Income,

marketing_campaign;\n```\n\n#### Positive Correlation:\n* Wines: 0.579\n* Meats: 0.585\n* Catalog Purchases: 0.589\n* Store Purchases: 0.529\n\n#### Negative Correlation:\n* Number of Web Visits: -0.553\n\n### Correlation Matrix:\n```\nSELECT \n    CORR(NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases) AS corr_deals_web,\n    CORR(NumDealsPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases) AS corr_deals_catalog,\n

correlations between different types of purchases, indicating that customers who purchase via one channel are likely to use other channels as well.\n* The highest correlation (0.519) is between catalog purchases and store purchases, suggesting a strong link between offline buying behaviors.\n#### Negative Correlations:\n* The number of web visits per month is negatively correlated with various types of purchases, possibly indicating that higher web activity does not necessarily translate to purchases.\n* Complaints and responses have a very slight negative correlation (-0.002), which aligns with the insight that dissatisfied customers are less likely to respond positively to campaigns.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n* **Higher Income, Higher Spending:** There is a strong positive correlation between income and spending on wines, meats, and catalog purchases.\n* **Education Impact:** Higher education levels (e.g., PhD) correlate with higher income and increased spending on premium products like wines.\n* **Campaign Performance:** Campaign 4 had the highest acceptance rate at 7.40%, while Campaign 2 had the lowest at 1.35%.\n* **Spending Behavior:** Married and individuals living together tend to spend more on wines and meats compared to other marital statuses.\n* **Impact of Complaints:** Complaints correlate with lower spending and lower response rates to campaigns. Addressing customer satisfaction could improve engagement and spending.\n* **Purchase Behavior Correlations:** Customers who engage in one type of purchase activity are likely to engage in others, particularly between catalog and store purchases. However, high web activity doesn't necessarily convert to higher purchases.\n* **Campaign Strategy:** Tailoring campaigns to customers who have not complained could yield better responses and higher spending. For customers who have complained, resolving their issues might be key to improving their future engagement and spending.","metadata":{}}]}
